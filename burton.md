## Why Burton needs B4RN

The current broadband service in most of the area is sold as “up to 8Mbps”.  It’s unusual to get the full 8Mbps though because it depends upon distance from the exchange and quality of the copper cable linking your property to the exchange.  Hence, typical broadband speed in in the area is 5Mbps download and 0.4Mbps upload.  The B4RN service is 1000Mbps download and 1000Mbps upload, irrespective of distance from your local B4RN cabinet.  This is 200x faster download and 2500x faster upload.  It might be more helpful to think of it like this: a B4RN broadband service removes the internet connection as being the bottleneck it traditionally has been. 

The limitation then becomes the user equipment in the home and the remote servers with which you are communicating.  Most customers seem to get a few hundred Mbps. While this is unbelievably fast, and almost all people will say they don’t need this, the world is ever-changing and who can predict what the internet will mean to us in 10 years’ time?   It’s also important to remember that speed isn’t everything, and a lot of people just want a reliable broadband connection that works perfectly all of the time, whenever you need it.

The B4RN service is designed solely to deliver a world-class broadband service, using the same fibre-optic cables that link data centres and countries, all the way from the internet exchange in Manchester to your property.  It doesn’t make use of ageing infrastructure and cables that were designed and laid decades ago to deliver something else: a telephone service.  As such, the glitches, slow speeds and temporary outages that we are all used to should be a thing of the past for B4RN customers.

As you can see from the above map, B4RN is available in many of the areas surrounding Burton-in Kendal. It would make sense that residents of Burton should be able to access the improved service that is available to other households and businesses a few kilometers away.
